# Small Office Network – Cisco Packet Tracer Project

## 📅 Year: 2024

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Networking simulation software used to design and simulate the office network topology.

## 📝 Project Description:
This project represents the design and implementation of a **Small Office Network** using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal was to build a functional network that could be used in a small office setting. The network includes various Cisco networking devices such as routers, switches, and access points, all of which are interconnected to form a complete system.

### Key Features:
- **Office Network Topology**: A hierarchical topology consisting of routers, switches, access points, and workstations.
- **IP Addressing**: Carefully planned IP addresses for each device on the network.
- **Routing Protocols**: Static routing configurations were applied to ensure data transmission between different network segments.
- **Network Security**: Basic security configurations for devices, including the use of passwords for accessing routers and switches.
- **File Sharing and Internet Connectivity**: The project also includes simulated configurations for file sharing between PCs and internet access for all devices.

## 🖧 Network Components:
1. **Router**: Used for routing packets between different subnets and connected to the Internet.
2. **Switches**: Multiple switches used to interconnect devices within the same subnet.
3. **Workstations**: PCs configured with IP addresses and connected to switches for file sharing.
4. **Access Points**: Providing wireless network access to employees.
5. **Servers**: A file server and web server for hosting internal resources.

## 📁 Project Files:
1. **Small University Network.pkt**: The main Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the complete network design and configuration.
2. **University Campus Network Layout Report.pdf**: A detailed report explaining the network setup, IP address scheme, and the rationale behind design choices.
3. **topology.png**: A visual representation of the network topology for easy understanding.
